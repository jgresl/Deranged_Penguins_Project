# **In Search of the Deranged Penguin**

An immersive AR/VR project exploring themes of individuality, group dynamics, and choice through the metaphor of penguin colonies and a lone, philosophical penguin.

## **Project Overview**
**"In Search of the Deranged Penguin"** invites users to engage in a thought-provoking experience inspired by Werner Herzog’s concept of a “deranged penguin.” Users explore a snowy landscape, choosing whether to stay with a group of penguins or pursue a lone penguin who has deviated from the flock. The project reflects philosophical ideas on freedom, choice, and solitude through immersive storytelling, combining AR and VR elements.

## **Features**
- **Multi-Path Storyline**: Users choose between following the flock or the lone penguin, each leading to different emotional experiences.
- **AR and VR Integration**: The experience is available in both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) formats, offering different levels of immersion.
- **Philosophical Themes**: Dialogue and narrative choices reflect ideas from philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, encouraging users to reflect on individuality and life paths.
- **Environmental Effects**: Dynamic weather changes, ambient sounds, and visual cues enhance immersion and guide the user’s experience.

## **AR Experience**
- **QR Code Activation**: Users scan a QR code to place virtual penguins in real-world spaces.
- **Interactive Penguins**: Users can tap penguins to trigger animations and thought bubbles with unique messages.
- **Proximity Events**: Events and dialogues are triggered based on the user’s movement within the AR environment.

---

## **VR Experience**
- **Exploration of Polar Landscape**: Users explore a polar environment with snowstorms, glaciers, and Northern Lights.
- **Branching Narratives**: Different choices lead to varied outcomes, mirroring the complexities of individual decisions.
- **Emotional Feedback**: Users' choices impact the background sounds and environment, shifting between cheerful and melancholic atmospheres.

## **Technical Requirements**
- **Assets**:
  - Penguin models from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/imperial-penguin-100397).
  - Custom model for the philosophical penguin.
  - Environmental effects using Unity’s Particle System for weather and dynamic lighting.

- **Core Mechanics**:
  - **QR Code Activation**: Loads AR elements into the real-world environment.
  - **Tap Interaction**: Users tap on penguins to trigger animations and dialogues.
  - **Proximity Triggers**: Dialogue activates when the user approaches the lone penguin.
  - **State Management System**: Controls active dialogues and animations based on user choices.
  - **Branching Narrative System**: Adjusts outcomes according to user decisions.

## **Team Responsibilities**
- **Brian Bian**: Storyline, documentation, script writing, model building, coding, and AR adaptation from VR.
- **Jonathan Gresl**: Scene building, programming VR interactions, animations, dialogue systems, and selection menus.
- **Touba Sheikhshab**: Storyline development, emotional impact, plot design, and VR/AR project validation.

## **How to Run**
1. **VR Mode**:
   - Open the Unity project and run the scene designed for VR.
   - Use a VR headset for the best immersive experience.

2. **AR Mode**:
   - Scan the QR code to place penguins in your environment.
   - Interact with penguins by tapping and following the lone penguin to unlock narrative events.

## **Philosophical Inspiration**
This project draws inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas about freedom and individuality. A fitting quote from Nietzsche used in the project:  
**"No one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but you yourself alone."**
